- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aetherian69
- 👀 I’m interested in Arm builds, I accidentally learned how to root a Mediatek LG Stylo 6 by complete accident just installing a new Arm to the second partition. I was then able to grant any apps Superude, my phone died and began to bootloop, I simply factory reset it and now here I am again trying to do other avenues similar to attempt that
